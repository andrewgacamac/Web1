                    <p>My passion for landscaping started at a young age. My father operated a small successful landscaping company and growing up I was very involved in the family business. I pursued this passion by achieving a diploma in Horticulture Science and Landscape Design from Humber College. It was there that I was able to mix my landscaping knowledge with 3D design. I take pride in building a company where great customer service and creating beautiful landscapes are at the forefront.</p>
